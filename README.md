# Hi guys! I'm Sam Wu 🚀

I'm a **Software Developer** based in **Boulder, CO**, dedicated to shipping work that will last as long as possible. I love doing reasearch, learning new things, and watching success scale. 
I'm more of a perfectionist, and believe in bringing the best out of myself through rigourous trial and error.
